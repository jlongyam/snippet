win-bash - A stand-alone bash for Windows
=========================================

win-bash is a Windows port of the famous GNU bash (see GNU Bash homepage). 
Unlike other bash ports for Windows (e.g. the  cygwin bash ),
the win-bash needs no special environment or DLLs. There is just one binary and that's it. 

win-bash is based on nt_bash which was an early bash port for Windows NT started
by Mountain Math Software some years ago. As far as I know,
the nt_bash port project stopped in alpha status and has never been finished. 

The goal of the win-bash project is to finish the port to Windows and
provide a fully-functional bash.exe binary for Windows NT and derived systems.
win-bash can be used as an input shell, as well as an interpreter to run UN*X shell scripts. 


INSTALLATION
============

The installation of win-bash is pretty simply:
Just download shell.w32-ix86.zip, unpack it and copy the bash.exe file to a path which is listed
in your PATH environment variable. 

When using win-bash as the default shell for un*x shell scripts,
you may which to copy bash.exe to sh.exe to make scripts starting with #!/bin/sh work. 

Remember:
This is only the shell binary - it has same builtin commands,
but for must purposes you would need additional un*x tools like ls, sed etc.
The unxutils project provides Windows ports of often used un*x tools.
